● How would you deploy this application in production?

consider the following steps:
1. Use actual AWS SQS and RDS services instead of Localstack and Dockerized Postgres.
2. Implement security measures, including access controls, encryption, and secure credentials management.
3. Set up monitoring and alerting to track pipeline performance and errors.
4. Use a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the application's deployment and scaling.

● What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?

Implementing a centralized logging solution like the Amazon CloudWatch Logs to collect and analyze application logs for debugging and performance monitoring
Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and control resource utilization

● How can this application scale with a growing dataset?

1. Optimize the database schema with proper indexing and partitioning strategies.
2. Consider using distributed message queues and database sharding for scalability.
3. Implement data parallelization and batching for more efficient processing.


● How can PII be recovered later on?

PII recovery could be achieved using secure key management and encryption techniques.
Decrypting masked data would require proper authorization and authentication mechanisms.
   
● What are the assumptions you made?

The provided JSON data follows a specific format consistent with SQS message structure.
MD5 hashing is considered sufficient for masking sensitive information, but stronger cryptographic methods could be used.
Hashing is chosen for masking data, considering its one-way transformation and ability to identify duplicates without exposing original values.
The assumed use of Docker and Localstack for development and testing purposes, with a transition to real AWS services in production.
The assumption is that the data processing workflow and architecture could change based on evolving requirements and technologies.
